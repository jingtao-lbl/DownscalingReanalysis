# Algorithm Package For Downscaling Reanalysis Products
This package contains three components that assembles codes for downscaling coarse-resolution reanalysis fields to high-resolution meteorological forcing for hydrological applications especially over topographically complex regions. Using the 3-hourly North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) as an example, the packages downscale 32-km  resolution NARR atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, specific humidity, wind speed, downward longwave and shortwave radiation to 1-km and hourly resolution. Users can modify the codes to apply to any other reanalysis products.

# ElevationCorrection
Package for elevation corrections to atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, specific humidity, and downward longwave radiation.
-	Instead of using the standard lapse rate (i.e., - 6.5 K/km), we derived dynamic lapse rates both in space and time.

# WindAdjustment
Package for downscaling wind speed from coarse-resolution to high-resolution accounting for heterogeneity.
-	Accouting 

# TopoCloudCorrSolarRad 
Package for downscaling coarse-resolution downward shortwave (solar) radiation to high-resolution, meanwhile accounting for topographic and cloudiness corrections.
