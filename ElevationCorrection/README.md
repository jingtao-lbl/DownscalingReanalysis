# Algorithm Package For Downscaling Reanalysis Products
By Jing Tao (jingtao@lbl.gov)

This repository contains three packages that assemble codes and scripts for downscaling coarse-resolution reanalysis fields while also accounting for topographic (and cloudiness) effects. The packages aim to generate high-resolution, high-accuracy meteorological forcing for hydrological applications, especially over topographically complex regions. Using the 3-hourly North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) as an example, the packages downscale 32-km resolution NARR atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, specific humidity, wind speed, downward longwave and shortwave radiation to 1-km and hourly resolution. Users can modify the codes to apply to any other reanalysis products.

# ElevationCorrection
A package for elevation corrections to reanalysis atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, specific humidity, and downward longwave radiation.
-	Instead of using the standard lapse rate (i.e., - 6.5 K/km), we derived dynamic lapse rates in space and time.
